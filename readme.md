## Iaido App

An application by Zedd Enterprises

### Production Launch

To launch the application to production, you must build your react app (in client folder) and copy/paste the files into the public folder.

In console, run the following commands:

-   <code>cd client</code>
-   <code>npm run build</code>

Once files are built, copy/paste all files from the generated build folder into the public folder and delete the build folder.
